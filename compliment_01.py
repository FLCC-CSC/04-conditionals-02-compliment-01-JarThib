1. On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is the hardest), how would you rate this lab?
I would rate it a 6. It was challenging, but I didn't have to refer to the notes too much.



2. What was the hardest part of this lab?
The hardest part of this lab was remembering to call the function after defining it.
I edited the code for like 20 minutes trying to figure out why it wouldn't run. I looked at
an old lab to see if I could buy a clue, and realized my code was missing 'main()' at the end.
silly mistake, but I don't remember doing that for other labs. So I probably missed it in the
notebooks somewhere.
